PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE 

TEAM AND OPERATIONS COORDINATOR
RIBALTA NYC (TOP 50 PIZZA USA) | 2020 – 2023
Led teams across three operational areas, improving workflows to ensure most orders were served in under 20 minutes during peak hours, handling over 400 customers per day. These improvements reduced errors and waste, enhanced cross-team collaboration, and improved the overall customer experience in high-pressure environments.

AUTOMATION ENGINEER
LUNA COMPANY S.A.S | 2018 - 2020
Developed Python-based systems to automate integrity inspection reports for oilfield tools. Implemented computer vision techniques to process UV and penetrant test images, enabling microfracture detection and automated result logging. This system streamlined the generation of hundreds of technical reports, cut reporting time by 40%, and improved traceability and quality control.

DATA ANALYST AND DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR
MAXIM & FISHING S.A.S. | 2015 - 2016
Automated documentation workflows by building databases in Excel and SQL and integrating MATLAB-based analysis models. These tools improved strategic reporting and document handling, enabling faster access to operational data and improved information retrieval for critical decision-making

WIRELINE FIELD ENGINEER
MAXIM & FISHING S.A.S. | 2014 - 2015
Performed wireline and well testing operations, managing pressure and temperature tests (fall-off, buildup, injection, interference) using wireline and gauge carrier tools. Supervised field testing to ensure data quality and reliability. Improved the consistency of downhole pressure/temperature logging for more accurate technical assessments.

OPERATIONS ANALYST
MAXIM & FISHING S.A.S. | 2013 - 2014
Provided analytical and operational support in various areas, ensuring compliance with QHSE requirements. Evaluated operational processes to properly implement the company’s integrated management system. Applied process improvements to reduce execution time and maintain quality standards.

PROJECTS

SYNTHETIC WELL LOG CURVE PREDICTION (2023 – PRESENT)
Designed machine learning and deep learning models in Python to predict synthetic well log curves (e.g., CNLS, RHOB, Formation) with up to 5× more accuracy than previous methods. Developed an interactive interface to allow technical and non-technical users to evaluate zones with missing or limited data, improving petrophysical assessments and reducing analysis time.

AUTOMATED TECHNICAL REPORTING WITH COMPUTER VISION (LUNA PROJECT) (2018 – 2020)
Built a Python-based computer vision system for large-scale inspection of oilfield tools, using nondestructive testing (NDT) image analysis. Integrated AI models to detect defects and link image evidence to structured databases, significantly reducing manual errors and speeding up technical reporting.

WATER INFLUX DETECTION IN RESERVOIRS (2016 – 2018)
Developed a MATLAB tool to identify water breakthrough in oil reservoirs using pressure test data and boundary condition simulations. Implemented pseudopressure analysis and calculated drainage area and original oil in place (OOIP). The tool helped reduce reserve estimation errors and improved water management and reservoir characterization under complex boundary conditions.
